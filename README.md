## What This Demonstrates

This project is intentionally designed as a professional-grade portfolio piece. It demonstrates:

- **Next.js App Router**
  - File-based routing
  - Server and client component boundaries

- **API Routes & Data Fetching**
  - Backend logic via `/api/audit`
  - Async client-side integration

- **Tailwind-Based UI Systems**
  - Utility-first styling
  - Consistent, scalable component design

- **Production Deployment**
  - Deployed on Vercel
  - Real CI/CD build pipeline
  - Environment parity between local and production

This project reflects how I approach real-world web applications: clean architecture, defensive UI logic, and production readiness.
